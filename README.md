Replication files for "Gender differences in the prosecution of police brutality: Evidence from a natural experiment in Sweden."

'OnlineAppendix.docx' contains the appendix for our main paper and several robustness checks.

'sak_data.csv' contains the data used in our paper. The records were obtained under a special freedom of information request (in Swedish: offentlighetsprincipen) that allows unredacted documents to be transferred within Swedish governmental bodies, which [Uppsala University] falls under. The documents were then coded and transformed into numerical measures. They were thereafter destroyed because they occasionally contained extemporaneous personal information about the complainant which would have necessitated secure data management measures for their retention. Should anyone wish to validate the coding of the decision, the variable "malnr" indicates the document id number registered with the Swedish Prosecution Authority and can be used to obtain the original document from Swedish Prosecution Authority. These decision documents fall under Swedish freedom of information laws and anyone can request them (Swedish citizenship is not required).

'sak.R' contains the R code necessary to replicate our analyses.
